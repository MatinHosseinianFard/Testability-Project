# Testability Project

## Introduction
This project consists of two phases focused on analyzing the **testability** of digital circuits using **ISCAS benchmark circuits**. The first phase involves circuit simulation and output analysis, while the second phase implements the **PODEM algorithm** to evaluate **controllability** and **observability** in circuits.

## Project Goals
- **Phase 1**: Simulate digital circuits and analyze their output for testability assessment.
- **Phase 2**: Implement the **PODEM algorithm** to detect faults and evaluate circuit observability and controllability.
